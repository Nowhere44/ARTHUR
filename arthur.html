THESIS
Ever since the French Revolution of 1789, every French citizen of legal age and of all walks of life get to elect their leader for the following years. Before this election is a period filled of numerous, endless and sterile debates. For months now, French candidates have been everywhere on the media, praising themselves, saying how good of a president they would be, how they would solve our society’s problems and trying to convince the people to vote for them. However, no one talks about the dark side of these candidates, their wrongs, faults, and even now, barely 2 months before the election, French citizen still find themselves unsure on which of the candidates to choose.</p>

BODY
That is why we decided to create this website, LOVNI, to remind the people that everyone has their flaws and that idealizing people, especially politicians, is wrong. We write an article on each candidate for the French presidential election, providing an objective display of the actions they took in the past, and analysing the measures they propose if they were elected, seeing if it is actually attainable or if it’s just fake promises to get elected. We gathered a variety of political, economic, and social experts from le Monde, le Figaro, Marianne… to help us write articles as close to the truth as possible. Keep in mind that we do not wish to display our political opinion or influence your opinion towards a specific politician, we only wish to help you find the politician who really endorses your ideas, opinions, and values, and to prevent people from voting for the media-favorite without truly knowing what they would do as a president. </p>


<p class="mb-4 font-bold text-white">  
CONCLUSION
We will treat each candidate the same way, with the same critical thinking. Furthermore, men lie, numbers don’t, which is why we have trustworthy fact checkers who review each piece of information posted on this website. With this being said, I wish you all a very pleasant read of our articles, and truly hope it will help you get a better picture of our candidates.  </p>
